Database Upgrade Maven Plugin

  This plugin lets you incrementally upgrade your project database schema and data during your development/product lifecycles.
  You can also use it's core component (dbupgrade-core) to perform your application's database upgrade at startup.

* Goals Overview

  There are 2 methods of upgrade

  * {{{dbupgrade-mojo.html}dbupgrade:generic-upgrade}}
    lets you hook up your global pre-upgrade, incremental upgrades, and finally global post-upgrade using both java and SQL 
    in your Java resources to upgrade multiple database types of your choice. Each incremental upgrade has an associated version 
    number to be stored in your configurable database version table. DBUpgrade uses your database version's value to 
    pickup the next upgrade in your java resource, if any.

  * {{{dbupgrade-mojo.html}dbupgrade:filelist-upgrade}}
    lets you hookup your sql upgrade script locations contained in a text file ( ie the text file contains a list of SQL script paths ). 
    After a SQL script is executed, its names is stored in your configurable database version table. DBUpgrade uses
    your database version's value ( a SQL script name ) to pickup the next upgrade script, if any.
